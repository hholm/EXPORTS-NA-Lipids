### Lipid Annotation Data and Sample Metadata
Basic sample metadata can be found in EXPORTS_NA_Sample_Metadata_csv. Lipid annotations retained from LOBSTAHS screening are available for positive and negative ionization mode (EXPORTS_NA_Negative_raw_csv, EXPORTS_NA_Positive_raw_csv). Additionally, lipid annotation information such as chemical formula, retention time, adduct mass, and annotations are included in the preliminary columns of this sheet. Lipid annotations are rows, samples are columns. All lipid units are integrated peak area. For full description of column information see the LOBSTAHS manual.
